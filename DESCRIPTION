Description: Describes a comparative analysis of scRNA-seq data using scran, scater and other Bioconductor packages.
    This uses a multi-condition replicated data set from a study of early mammalian development. It demonstrates how 
    merge sample together to test for differential abundance and differential expression between conditions.
